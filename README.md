# Mint Panda's Week 0 Project: Todo App

Live: https://mint-panda-todo-list.web.app/

Our team created a simple to-do app using React and Firebase. Using Material UI we were able to integrate some really nice UI elements. We used a project board to track tasks, and pull requests to review changes before merging. As others have said, this did slow things down a bit but did help the project stay relatively stable throughout development. 

Challenges: 
One of our team members working on the front end was new to Github, React and MUI, so there was a bit of a learning curve to get over before making progress, which set development back a somewhat. By the end development sped up considerably, but was a bit more haphazard due to trying to meet the deadline. 
There were delays at times due to schedules not lining up which is to be expected. The team still did a great job in communicating and helping each other when they did have time.
Some merge conflicts occurred due to multiple people working on different versions of the same files, but we were able to sort those out and get a project completed that does 90% of what we wanted it to do in a short timeframe.
In future projects, it would be useful to create a design mockup beforehand. There may have been a bit of hesitancy to create new components because we didn't have a design plan to go off of so styling choices were arbitrary and it was hard to know how those choices would effect components that others were making.

Remaining:
 if we had more time we were planning to add completed dates to tasks when completed, and style tasks differently according to their status. We were also planning to go with a more short-form date format, displayed in the user's time zone.
